Faltering Trade Talks Send Shares Slightly LowerBy THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 646 words25 September 2018Global stocks took small losses on Monday after China reportedly pulled out of trade talks with the United States. Industrial companies and banks suffered some of the worst declines among American stocks.The United States and China officially began taxing larger amounts of each other's goods on Monday, and The Wall Street Journal reported that China had pulled out of talks that could have led to a new round of negotiations to end the trade war.The United States is now taxing another $200 billion in Chinese imports at a rate of 10 percent, and China added taxes of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion in American products. Oil prices jumped after OPEC decided not to produce more oil.Technology and health care companies rose, leaving United States indexes only slightly lower.''The market's been remarkably resilient over the last couple of months while trade tensions were heating up,'' said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.Sandven said that the trade spat would endure past the midterm elections in November but that stocks were likely to keep rising because of strong earnings growth for American companies, combined with low inflation and low interest rates.The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.30 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,919.37. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 181.45 points, or 0.7 percent, to 26,562.05. Both the S.&P. 500 and the Dow set record highs last week.The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks dropped seven points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,705.32. The Nasdaq composite rose 6.29 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,993.25.After a volatile stretch early this year, the S.&P. hasn't risen or fallen 1 percent in a day since late June.Sandven noted that this year's gains have been concentrated in technology, retail and health care companies. That was the case Monday, as Apple gained 1.4 percent to $220.79 and Abbott Laboratories, which makes drugs and infant formula, advanced 3.5 percent to $71.44. Sandven said it would be an encouraging sign for the market if other sectors did better.Investors in the United States were occupied with other news. OPEC and its key allies, like Russia, decided not to increase their oil output further. Production is falling in some OPEC nations, including Iran, which faces new sanctions from the United States.Benchmark United States crude gained 1.8 percent to $72.08 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, the international standard for oil prices, rose 3 percent to $81.20 a barrel in London, its highest price in more than three years.Airlines and other transportation companies fell as investors anticipated that they would have to pay higher prices for fuel.Late Friday, Comcast won an auction for majority control of Sky, the British satellite TV giant. Its final offer was worth about $39 billion and topped an offer from 21st Century Fox, which was already a major Sky shareholder.In London, Sky shares jumped 8.6 percent. Comcast sank 6 percent to $35.63, while Fox rose 1.5 percent to $45.01. Disney, which is buying Fox, climbed 2.1 percent to $112.77.Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.09 percent from 3.07 percent.Gold rose to $1,199.30 an ounce. The dollar rose to 112.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.1744 from $1.1747.
